Game Plan: Fork(), child will ls in directory and read each string with strcmp to the argument given, if no file matches that, it will return a null char, if it finds it, it will pipe the return to the parent, do this for each directory in the char*array[], parent will read from the pipe each time creating another char*arrays[] so that it will store the directory anywhere that it finds ls, then it will run those through execve. Our other option is just create a char * that stores current directory and keep switching back to the current directory.
